# Filtration Model
Repository for Filtration Model subteam founded in 2020.
## Past Research Advisor

William Pennock: whp28@cornell.edu

## Past Team Members
Malini Balachandran: mvb37@cornell.edu

## Team Goal
This team will be working to implement a python model to develop a new understanding of filtration. This python model will keep track of how clogged each pore is in the filter, the head loss, and the particle capture efficiency all as a function of time. This team will be using many of the core equations developed building this predictive filtration model.
